Dependency Injection (DI) in C#:

Definition:

Dependency Injection is a design pattern in C# where a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.
Features:

Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed through a class's constructor.

Interfaces/Abstractions: Dependencies are defined by interfaces or abstract classes for loose coupling.

IoC Containers: Frameworks like Autofac automate the DI process.

Dependency Lifetime: Specify if a dependency should be a singleton, transient, or scoped.

Unit Testing: Facilitates easy testing with mock or fake dependencies.

Reduced Code Coupling: Promotes flexibility by reducing tight connections between classes.

In essence, DI helps create modular, testable, and maintainable code by managing dependencies externally, improving code organization, and promoting good design principles.
